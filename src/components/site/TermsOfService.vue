<p>WriteFlow ("we," "us," or "our") is pleased to offer certain web services ("Services") according to the terms and conditions in this Agreement ("Agreement"). By creating an account to use the Services you agree to this Agreement. If you represent an organization, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on behalf or your organization. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do not use the Services.</p>

<p>1. SERVICES</p>
<p>You may access and use our Services in accordance with this Agreement. The Services may include features or services that have separate rules specific to the feature or service. You will comply with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the use of the Services and any additional feature or service you use. You may access and use the Services solely for your internal business purposes. You understand and agree that we may change, suspend or discontinue any part of the Services and the Services as a whole. We will notify you of any material change to or discontinuation of the Services by email or via our website.</p>

<p>2. REGISTRATION AND YOUR ACCOUNT</p>
<p>To register to use the Services you must provide an email address and password. Do not disclose your password or other authentication information to any unauthorized persons. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including contractors or agents) and we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account. You will contact us immediately if you believe an unauthorized third party may be using your account or if your account information is lost or stolen. You will provide complete and accurate information during the registration process and will update it to ensure it remains accurate.</p>

<p>3. YOUR DATA</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of your data. You will ensure that your data, and your use of it, complies with this Agreement and any applicable law. You are responsible for properly using the Services and taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, of your data. If you include any data about any individual in your use of our Service, (1) we will hold and store your data on your behalf, and you are the data controller of such data; (2) we will process this data in compliance with your instructions and will not use or process any of this data for any purpose except the performance of our obligations under this Agreement; and (3) you warrant that your instructions to us comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and that you have all appropriate consents enabling you to use our Service. You represent and warrant that you will not store or process protected health information using the Service. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or destruction of your stored information and data. We routinely collect and analyze metadata regarding user files and usage data, excluding any personal data, but including header information, checksum quantities, file size, file type, and archival dates. We use this information to gauge Services levels and application performance, for our own marketing purposes, and, in some instances, for data recovery purposes. We do not make previous historical usage data available to you, and may delete any usage data older than 30 days.</p>

<p>4. PAYMENT AND TAXES</p>
<p>(a) Services Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges as described on the Service site. If you choose monthly billing by credit card, you authorize a recurring monthly charge to your credit card for the Service based on our current fee schedule for the Service. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Services as described on the site using your credit card. All amounts payable for the Services will be made without setoff or deduction, and all amounts paid are non-refundable. We may increase or add new fees and charges for the Service at any time. In the event that we change the pricing for the Service, the fees payable by you may increase or decrease in accordance with any such modification upon the date specified on the Service site.</p>

<p>(b) Taxes. All fees and charges payable by you are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. You will provide us any information we reasonably request to determine whether we are obligated to collect VAT from you, including your VAT identification number. If you are legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, you are responsible for providing us with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction. We will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under your account occurring after the date we receive the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.</p>

<p>5. SUSPENSION FOR NON-PAYMENT</p>
<p>Without limiting other available remedies included in this Agreement or otherwise, we may suspend your access to the Services if you are late in payment.</p>

<p>6. TERM; TERMINATION</p>
<p>(a) Term; Termination. The term of this Agreement commences when you create an account and will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with this Agreement.

<p>10. INDEMNIFICATION</p>
<p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning: (a) your use of the Services (including any activities under your account and use by your employees and personnel); (b) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable law by you; or (c) your data or the combination of your data with other applications, content or processes, including any claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights by your data or by the use, development, design, production, advertising or marketing of your data.

You will not assign this Agreement, or delegate or sublicense any of your rights under this Agreement, without our prior written consent. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit our right to enforce such provision at a later time. If any portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>(b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.

The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>

<p>(e) Force Majeure.

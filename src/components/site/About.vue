          <h2 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Hi, I'm Lyndon, the creator of WriteFlow :)</h2>

          <br>

          <h3 class="title is-5">People tell me that I'm good at talking, but I <i>dread</i> having to do any writing.</h3>

          <p>I think it has something to do with the more permanent feeling writing has vs. talking. When talking I can always continue on if I've missed a point, and whoever I'm talking with can go, "Oh yeah, I see what you mean..."</p>

          <p>However, when writing, the order of what you say and the structure is important. Without those the writing is messy. Things may be difficult to read. Your point isn't proven as well.</p>

          <p>Awhile back I had an essay writing assignment to do. But I had writers block each time I looked at the word processor. I knew I had so many points to write about, but I would hesitate putting words on the page. What made writing difficult for me is that I suffer from being a perfectionist. I was trying to get it right the first time. Deep down I was probably just afraid of my writing not sounding good.</p>

          <p>What's interesting is that in highschool I was enrolled in honors English and Social Studies. I probably wrote two or three essays a week.</p>

          <h3 class="title is-5">So what happened to my writing abilities?</h3>

          <p>In college I studied marketing, where <i>everything</i> was about doing presentations in front of the class. Then I went into computer science, where I did pretty much no writing at all. That was years ago.</p>

          <p>Back to my writing assignment. After much productive time lost, I thought I'd shift my approach. I tried just writing like how I talk. Whatever came to mind went on the page, and I'd edit it later.</p>

          <h3 class="title is-5">This reminded me of how I wrote some of my best essays from back in highschool.</h3>

          <p>First, I would write out everything I had to say in bullet point form.</p>

          <p>Next, I would rearrange the points in an order that made sense and group them to form paragraphs.</p>

          <p>Then, I would remove the bullets and make edits so everything sounded nice.</p>

          <p>Add a title, name, and date. Hand it in. Get an A. <b>That's it.</b></p>

          <p>The experience made me think, "There must be other people who want to write essays or blog articles that also struggle with writing. Maybe this would make a good app." But I left it at that.</p>

          <p>Fast forward a year, and I started dating a fantastic girl who has three teenage kids. She told that her middle child, while able to get good grades on her writing assignments, actually has lots of trouble with them. That she would spend hours late into the night (and sometimes, into the early morning) laboring in front of her computer, stressing over what to write and how. She also told me how lots of her peers also have the same difficulty with writing.</p>

          <h3 class="title is-5">And so, I decided to turn my tried and true writing approach into an app.</h3>

          <p>WriteFlow's approach is pretty much like how I described my old approach. But I've taken it further by including <strong>templates</strong> that help make sure arguments/points have adequate supporting statements.</p>

          <p>I believe this approach is applicable to various forms of writing. In the near future, I'll be adding templates for cover letters, resum√©s, and more.</p>

          <p>It is my sincere hope that WriteFlow helps people produce great writing. While there certainly are those that do so naturally, others&mdash;such as myself&mdash;could benefit from having a systematic approach. And who knows, maybe after using WriteFlow for awhile, you'll become a natural too :)</p>

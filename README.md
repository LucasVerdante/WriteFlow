# WriteFlow - https://getwriteflow.com (defunct)

WriteFlow was a SAAS product I tried to create a few years ago to help high school students write essays. It was my first attempt at using Vue.js and MongoDB Stitch to develop a complete app.

**Warning** - this is not a current example of what a Vue app should look like.

## Build Setup

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
